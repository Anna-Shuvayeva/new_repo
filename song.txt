You have my heart
And we’ll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines
But you’ll still be my star
Baby cause in the dark
You can’t see shiny cars
And that’s when you need me there
With you I’ll always share
Because


"Bitch better have my money"
Bitch better have my money!
Y'all should know me well enough
Bitch better have my money!
Please, don't call me on my bluff
Pay me what you owe me!
Ballin' bigger than LeBron
Bitch, give me your money!
Who y'all think y'all frontin' on?
Like bra, bra, bra
